# DelegationModule

This is the DelegationModule, a ROS-package for decentralized delegations in multi-agent-systems/multi-robot-systems. 
For these delegations a variation of a first-price sealed-bid auction will be used to ensure a favourable allocation.

## How to use this package?

* Implement the abstract classes *GoalWrapperBase* and *CostEvaluatorBase* according to your needs

* Implement the *DelegationClientBase* according to your needs and instantiate the Client at the 
    components that should be able to participate or start auctions

* Instantiate the *DelegationManager* (DM) at all participating components and at least one for components
    that should start auctions
   
* Register the corresponding DMs at all components (or automatize the DM construction and registering)

* add the suiting CostEvaluators for the participating DMs

* start delegations as you please

* the DMs should receive a step (*do_step* function)repeatedly to work properly (this can be made directly or via the clients)

For more Details see code documentation in form of doc-strings.

## Origin of this package

Author: Vito Mengers

This package was created for my bachelor-thesis with the topic (german)
*"Automatisierte Zielzerlegung f√ºr Multi-Roboter-Systeme innerhalb eines hybriden Planungssystems"*
(*translated: "Automated task decomposition within a hybrid behaviour network architecture of multi-robot-systems"*).
It is used there inside an expansion of the *ROS Hybrid Behaviour Planner* (RHBP) 
(see on [github](https://github.com/DAInamite/rhbp))
